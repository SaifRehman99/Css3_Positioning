# Css3_Positioning

Positioning in Css3 using Box Models,Floats,Clear and Many More

#IMPORTANT_NOTE

1)Box Model only apply to the Block Level Elements, it doesnt work on the inline Elements.
 We Have to convert the inline to display:block, inorder to apply the box model.

2)Inline Elements stack from left to right and Block Level Elements stack from top to bottom.
 Normal Document Flow is the flow of the elements in the webpage

3)In Floating there is no height so div around it will adopt the same property of float so we need to clear it first
4)After Clearing we resume our Document Flow
 We can clear using a empty div or a pesudu class
